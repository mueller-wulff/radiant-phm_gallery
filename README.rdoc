=== phm_gallery 

a radiant extension to create big galleries direct from filesystem folders with automatic captions

=== Features

- different pictures for thumb and fullsize

for full description & explantions go to http://over9000.org/rails/phm_gallery-a-gallery-generator-for-radiant

=== Dependencies

you need 'mini_exiftool' in order to use the automatic caption feature.

=== Compatibility

only tested against radiant 0.9

=== Installation
 
  ruby script/extension install phm_gallery

or via git
  
  cd /path/to/radiant

  git clone git://github.com/elmacnifico/radiant-phm_gallery.git vendor/extensions/phm_gallery


=== Setup

0. (optional) set the exif caption of your pictures (the 'headline' tag to be exact)
1. name your pictures according to the convention someiamge_thumb / someimage_big (so pic01_big, pic01_thumb, pic02_big, pic_thumb etc.)
2. upload your pictures to a subfolder of /path/to/radiant/public (for example "pics")

=== Usage

go to the page where you want the thumbnail gallery to appear and enter
  <r:phm_thumbs path="/path/to/gallery" single_path="/page/where/single/fullsize/image/will/appear" wrap="|" >Gallery</r:phm_thumbs>

the parameter path should be clear (in our example above it would be "/pics")

the parameter wrap gives you the possiblity to wrap every single thumbnail with smth. (i.e. divs or spans) the | is the postion of the image tag
so: wrap="<div class='thumbnail'>|</div>" would create an according div around every thumb.

since we don't use any fancy lightbox effects to display the fullsize images we need a page to display the "single view"

so go ahead an create a new page in your radiant an give it fitting name
take the slug of it  (i.e. "/pics/single_view") and paste it into the 'single_path' parameter from earlier

on the single_view page you have several tags to create a custom single view:

to display the "_big" picture
  <r:phm_single_pic>Picture</r:phm_single_pic>

to display a "prev" link
  <r:phm_prev_link>&laquo; prev</r:phm_prev_link>

to display a "next" link
  <r:phm_next_link >next &raquo;</r:phm_next_link>

to display the caption of a picture (the exif stuff from before)
  <r:phm_subtitle >Caption</r:phm_subtitle>
